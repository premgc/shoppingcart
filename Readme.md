HMRC:: ShoppingCart Requirements

Step 1: Shopping cart

● You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.

● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.

● Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost

  For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
  
● Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input


Step 2: Simple offers

● The shop decides to introduce two new offers

	○ buy one, get one free on Apples
	
	○ 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
	
● Update your checkout functions accordingly
